	  <h1>Dark</h1>
	  <p><img src="../images/dark.jpg" width="250" height="165" alt=""/><span style="font-family: neonoir, 'sans-serif;'; font-size: 20px;">I am what I am.</span>  I am a girl of few words with much on her mind.  I am a person who keeps to herself but won’t shut up at the same time.  I am a deep, dark abyss that let’s all in but light.  I am in search of confidence, but come up empty-handed half the time.  I am a child desperately clinging to a blanket woven of doubt and fear.  I am a face that won’t express how it truly feels.  I am a smile painted on upside down and a frown that just wants to turn around.   I am the mouth that won’t open when it really should.  I am skin beginning to glisten, a pounding heart, and a mind that goes blank when heads start to turn.

	  <h1>Light</h1>
	  <p><img src="../images/sunlight.jpg" alt="" width="250" height="167" class="floatLeft"/><span style="font-family: neonoir, 'sans-serif;'; font-size: 20px;">I am what I am.</span>  I am a girl who acknowledges her faults and accepts them, but I am not a girl who lets them define her overall.  I am what I am.   I am a passionate storm of tenacity and determination.  I am the girl who won’t let the problem remain unsolved.  I am a reader who won’t let a word go unread.  I am a fierce competitor and a caring friend.   I am able to understand another point of view but defend my own.  I am independent.  I am willing to accept help, but only after truly attempting a task first. I am a fifteen-year-old girl who looks twelve but that's no reason to underestimate me.  I am what I am.

	  <h1>The Light in the Dark</h1>
	  <p><img src="../images/light_in_dark.jpg" width="250" height="153" alt=""/><span style="font-family: neonoir, 'sans-serif;'">I am what I am.</span> I am a person who refuses to let my faults keep her from achieving my goals.  I am exactly five feet tall but my ambitions give me an extra foot.  I am an aspiring literary expert.  I am accepting of knowledge and value education.   I am willing to step up to the challenge and overcome any obstacles I face.  I am preparing for the future though  I still have much to learn.  I am not perfect, but I hope for personal growth in the future.  For now, I am what I am.
